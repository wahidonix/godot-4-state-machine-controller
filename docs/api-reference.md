**Usage:**
```gdscript
func exit():
    print("Exiting walking state")
```

---

### JumpingState
**File:** `scripts/states/jumping_state.gd`

Handles the ascending phase of jumps.

#### Constants
```gdscript
const SPEED = 5.0           # Air control speed
const JUMP_VELOCITY = 4.5   # Initial jump velocity
```

#### Key Behaviors
- Sets upward velocity on enter
- Applies gravity
- Allows **camera-relative air control**
- Character **rotates to face movement direction** while jumping

## Extension Points

### Adding New States

1. **Create state class**:
```gdscript
extends State
class_name CustomState

func physics_update(delta: float):
    # Your logic here
    pass
```

2. **Register in player**:
```gdscript
state_machine.add_state("custom", CustomState.new(self))
```

3. **Add transitions in other states**:
```gdscript
if some_condition:
    state_machine.change_state("custom")
```

### Custom Debug Information

Extend the debug UI by adding new labels and updating them in `update_debug_info()`.

### State Machine Events

You can add an event system to the state machine:

```gdscript
# In StateMachine
signal state_changed(from_state, to_state)

func change_state(state_name: String):
    var old_state = current_state
    # ... existing logic ...
    emit_signal("state_changed", old_state, current_state)
```

## Performance Notes

- Only one state is active at a time
- State transitions are lightweight operations
- Debug UI updates only when visible
- No unnecessary condition checking across states
- Physics calculations respect Godot's physics timestep
