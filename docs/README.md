# Player Controller Template Documentation

This project provides a modular 3D player controller for Godot 4.4.1 using a state machine architecture.

## Quick Start

1. Open the project in Godot 4.4.1
2. Run the `test.tscn` scene
3. Use WASD to move, Space to jump
4. Press `~` (tilde) to toggle debug UI

## Documentation Structure

- [State Machine Architecture](state-machine.md) - Detailed explanation of the state machine system
- [Adding New States](adding-states.md) - Guide for extending the controller with new behaviors
- [Debug Tools](debug-tools.md) - Using the built-in debugging features
- [API Reference](api-reference.md) - Complete class and method documentation

## Features

- ✅ Modular state-based architecture
- ✅ Smooth movement and jumping physics
- ✅ Real-time debug UI
- ✅ Easy to extend with new states
- ✅ Clean separation of concerns
- ✅ Phantom Camera integration ready
